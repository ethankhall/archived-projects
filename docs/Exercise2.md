## Exercise 2 - Rebase from origin

So, intent behind this exercise is going to simulate when you have a remote server (like [GitHub](http://github.com)) where others commit to the repo.

After you run `scripts/exercise2.sh` you will have a repository set up in `workspace/exercise2`. This repo was cloned from `repo/exercise2`. So that would mean that the remote origin points to `repo/exercise2`. So the setup script creates origin repo, after 2 commits `workspace/exercise2` was cloned. Then another commit was made to origin.

There is a typo in filename `workspace/exercise2/books/Pirde_and_Predudice.txt`. Fix the spelling, then add another book from [Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/), a place to get free books. Add the link to the book you added to README.md, like the other books are.
