# Exercise 0 - Git Into

## What is Git
Git is a source control system. It allows you to manage versions of files. Any file. Git is used mostly with text files. Git tracks what changes in your repository.

#### Repository
A repository is Git lingo for where you keep source. A git repository contains *all* the changes in the source. This means that you have a full history of everything done in the repository. Unlike SVN where you need access to the server to review history, Git allows you to view history at any point in time.

Another difference is that Git doesn't track files. It tracks changes. Renaming a file only contains the filename changes, not the actual contents.

#### Commit
A commit in Git is the set of changes that have been done the repository since the last commit. Every commit (except the first) has at least one parent. Commits are like a [Directed Graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph).
